# **Welcome to IntegraTax**

**IntegraTax** is a user-friendly software for clustering DNA sequences and an interactive workspace with dendrograms to support species delimitation and taxonomic research.

IntegraTax supports taxonomic decision-making directly on barcode-based hierarchies, with clustering structure and associated distance information generated once and retained while decisions are made and revised in a browser-based workspace. IntegraTax is designed to treat taxonomic interpretation as an ongoing interaction with the preserved hierarchy and its properties, rather than as a downstream step based on derived summaries. 

## Get Started

## Main Functions

IntegraTax provides two core functions:

**1.** **Clustering** - Generates complete single-linkage hierarchies with information required for later taxonomic decisions. This information is preserved rather than collapsed into fixed clusters.

**2.** **Taxonomy** - An interactive workspace that displays the clusters and specimens as an dendrogram (Cluster Fusion Diagram) that can be annotated by taxonomists.

IntegraTax places taxon-relevant classification and summary calculations directly within the workspace. Unstable clusters, LIT-based specimen groupings, congruence-based dendrogram colouring, alternative species hypotheses, and measures such as match ratios, specimen congruence, and SPART summaries are handled on the hierarchy itself, enabling progressive taxonomic decisions without reliance on external, snapshot summaries.
