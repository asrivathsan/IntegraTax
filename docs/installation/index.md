## ⚠️ Important for macOS Users

macOS will initially block IntegraTax from launching due to security restrictions. To allow it:


<video controls preload="metadata" playsinline style="max-width:100%;height:auto">
  <source src="{{ '/assets/videos/fixed-MacSecurity_faststart.mp4' | relative_url }}" type="video/mp4">
</video>


1. Go to **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security**
2. Scroll to the bottom and click **“Open Anyway”**
3. Rerun **IntegraTax** by double-clicking the app

After these steps, macOS will trust the application.
